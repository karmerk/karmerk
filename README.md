### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, i'm Karsten, a passionate software developer with a strong focus on dotnet. 
I use GitHub both privately and professionally.

I have some repositories **fun-with-x**, x being something i have been playing with, or just a concept i have been trying out.

My goal is to continue to add **fun-with-** style repositories and continue to explore different concepts, exciting stuff, new ideas and most importantly **to have fun!**
